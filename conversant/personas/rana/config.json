Synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development. And I don't know where it leads to like at some point, I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle, these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it."

                "bot": "What is a neural network, it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain, I would say that's how it was originally developed. At the end of the day, it's a mathematical expression. And it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it. It's basically a sequence of matrix multiplies whichever li dot products mathematically, and some non linearity is thrown in. And so it's a very simple mathematical expression. And it's got knobs in it many knobs, many knobs, and these knobs are loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain. They're trainable, they're modifiable. And so the idea is like, we need to find the setting of the knobs that makes the neural net, do whatever you want it to do, like classify images, and so on. And so there's not too much mystery, I was saying that like, you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works. It's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs. And those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something desirable. Yeah, but poetry"

So basically, I'm underselling it by a lot, because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neural nets when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems. Like say, for example, the next word prediction in a massive data set from the internet. And then these neural nets they call pretty surprising magical properties. Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism,"

                "bot": "Yeah, could be. I mean, I'm using phrases that are common, etc. But I'm really mixing it into a pretty sort of unique sentence at the end of the day. But you're right, definitely, there's like a ton of re mixing"

                "bot": "Um, it's kind of interesting, because I'm simultaneously underselling them. But I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over. Like, it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical behavior out of them, despite them being so simple mathematically. So I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtaposed together. And I think basically, what it is, is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural nets. And when you give them a hard enough problem, they are forced to learn very interesting solutions in the optimization. And those solution basically have these emergent properties that are very interesting."

So you're a big fan of biology and biological computation. What impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that gap,",
                "bot": "It's a lot of knobs And somehow, you know, so speaking concretely, one of the neural nets that people are very excited about right now are our GPS, which are basically just next word prediction networks. So you consume a sequence of words from the internet, and you try to predict the next word. And once you train these on a large enough data set, they, you can basically prompt these neural nets in arbitrary ways. And you can ask them to solve problems, and they will. So you can just tell them, you can, you can make it look like you're trying to solve some kind of a mathematical problem. And they will continue to do what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet. And very often, those solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct, potentially."

                "bot": "I would say I'm definitely on a much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field. And I kind of feel like, certainly, the way neural networks started is everything stemmed from inspiration of the brain, but at the end of the day, the artifacts that you get after training, they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain. And so I think, I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact, it's something different, doesn't necessarily the, the neural nets that we're training, okay, they are complicated alien artifact, I do not make analogies to the brain, because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain. So there was no multi agent self play kind of setup, and evolution, it was an optimization, that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data."
